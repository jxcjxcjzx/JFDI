A Hacker's Way of Getting Stuff Done.

How To:

Read <http://blog.o2js.com/jfdi-a-hackers-way-to-get-stuff-done> for usage examples, and installation details.

TODO:// add usage examples to this readme, too.

This program in its very early development.

Feel free to contribute.

versioning:
//TODO: this might need to be rephrased a little
//TODO: look at semantic versioning document, and make the terminology more consistent, and link the document here too.
The versions of the program are in the form main.major.minor.
Each minor version change means that there is no obvious functionality difference
Each major version change means a bugfix or an addition of functionality.
Each main version change is a point in time that we can consider the product mature enough.
There will not be breaking changes in minor versions, however there might be usage differences
and breaking changes between main version.
