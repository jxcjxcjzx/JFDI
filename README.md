# A Hacker's Way of Getting $#!% Done

## Every Saga Has a Beginning

It all started with
[the **JFDI** Methodology](https://gist.github.com/v0lkan/2694911) and
[the **JFDI** Manifesto](https://gist.github.com/v0lkan/2731233)

> **JFDI** is a *command line interface* to help you focus what goals
you can achieve **right now**.

### Why A Command Line Interface?

Because, we geeks live in the terminal. And using something that is already
open, and is most of the time in front of your eyes, will help you beat the
inertia of launching a separate app, to manage your goals.

> Adding a **JFDI** goal is as simple as `jfdi save the world`. You don't have
> to wait for your shiny dandy GTD desktop app to launch; index its tasks;
> connect to the Internet; sync recent data; render a pretty UI; and then
> wait for you to click the "add task" button.
>
> You just type your goal, hit **enter** and **bang!** it's there.

No process can be less interruptive, and faster than this!

The main aim of the application is to help you **what need to be get done
today**. So unlike other productivity <stike>pron</stike> apps, in **JFDI**
you will not find dates, schedules, reminders, labels&hellip; to distract
yo away.

### Why Right Now?

Because it's f\*cking **JFDI**!

## Planning Is a Bummer

Admit it, most of the time you don't plan launching manless spaceships to the
moon. Your typical is something like

* Fix bug id UNP9959: Unicorns and ponies should live together.
* Remember the milk.
* Save the world.

Why torture your brain by setting *due dates* weeks from now
to those simple tasks?! Just bump it to tomorrow, and **JFDI** what you can do
**right now**.

> Every day, your tomorrow goals will be carriead over to the bottom of your
**today** queue; and you will deal with themm when when their time comes.
If a goal will neither be done today, nor in a foreseeable future you can move
it to a **later** queue and **JFDI** won't bother you until you have time for
that goal.

* *TODO://* the above feature is not implemented yet; it is in our **JFDI**
queue.

## It is Plain Text Files, Baby

Do you know what is universally reachable, and modifiable, withouth needing
to download special software? A plain text file. You can edit your text file
on your Mac, on your PC, in your smart phone, in your tablet&hellip; Text files
are damn fast to edit; **they do not distract you**.

What **JFDI** does is similar. It maintains *plain text files* in a sync
directory of your choice. So if you set your sync directory to something like

`/home/procrastinator/Dropbox/JFDI/`

(being /home/procrastinator/Dropbox/ your [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com/) folder)

then you can edit these files wherever you want. You can sort your priorities
even when you are offline. And once you are done, they will be syncronized
everywhere.

**JFDI** is a **command line interface** that maintains three text files:

* **today.txt**,
* **tomorrow.txt**,
* and **done.txt**;

and it gives you the liberty to modify them however you like.

It will play nicely, as long as you remmember to keep each goal in a separate
line.

> So you can edit you goals even without using **JFDI**; and it it won't blow
up anything.


### Setup

&hellip; coming soon &hellip;

You can read <http://o2js.com/jfdi-a-hackers-way-to-get-stuff-done>
for usage examples, and installation details, and ways to begin with;
until this section is prepared.

### Contribute

This program in its very early development.

Feel free to contribute.

### Other

versioning:

//TODO: this might need to be rephrased a little

//TODO: look at semantic versioning document, and make the terminology more consistent, and link the document here too.

The versions of the program are in the form main.major.minor.

Each minor version change means that there is no obvious functionality difference

Each major version change means a bugfix or an addition of functionality.

Each main version change is a point in time that we can consider the product mature enough.

There will not be breaking changes in minor versions, however there might be usage differences

and breaking changes between main version.
